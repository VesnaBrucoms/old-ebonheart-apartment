Come across a lady who needs escorting to OE. Once you get her there, her & her partner let you stay in their guest room. Maybe also really cheap rent?

Simple quest, very low/no stakes.

The lady went out to harvest plants and capture insects and small wildlife and got a bit lost. Her partner chides her upon return.

Killing either results in not getting the apartment.

They have a pet rat called Rattus. After renting she falls ill and the PC must help by curing her. Choosing not to help (not timed, a dialogue decline) will lead to Rattus dying, then the wildlife lady a few days later. Maybe the other one commits suicide after? Really fucking dark, maybe not

Rattus will also give random small loot if the PC feeds her. She'll give really good stuff if PC feeds her her favourite food
