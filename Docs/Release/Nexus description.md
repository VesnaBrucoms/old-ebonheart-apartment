## Full

A mod for Tamriel Rebuilt, Old Ebonheart Apartment adds a house with a rentable apartment just outside of the city. It becomes available once you complete a little quest first.

Adds:

* A brief and simple quest
* A lovely cozy apartment, to decorate as you desire
* Special homebrew courtesy of the owner to take on your adventures

## Directions

To get to the house, just head out of Old Ebonheart's main gate. It will be the house to your right.

An alternative start to the quest is to head north from [spoiler]Dondril[/spoiler] and to keep an eye out
for a conspicuous woman.

## Content

As a heads up, the two landladies are a married lesbian couple.
