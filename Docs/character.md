Primary characters:
* Aeliana Faustus - Imperial woman who migrated to Morrowind to study the plants. Bought the house with her inheritance.
* Urtiso Faustus - Dunmer woman who has always lived in Morrowind. Used to be in the Fighters Guild until she met Aeliana.

After her father's death, Aeliana used her inheritance to move to Morrowind. Buying a house in Old Ebonheart. She met Urtiso while out gathering samples around the river. Urtiso was coming back from a Fighter's Guild job. Aeliana was lost and so Urtiso escorted her back. From there the two of them started seeing each other, and eventually marrying. With Urtiso leaving her position at the guild to help Aeliana with her side work of alchemy (and to keep her safe).

On this ocaision Urtiso was out assisting with some smithing work when Aeliana decided to head out on her own as she missed Urtiso. Inevitably she got lost. Upon her return Urtiso quickly realised what happened and went out to search for her, but couldn't find her as she assumed she had gone sample gathering, not after her.

The PC can either come across Aeliana (with Nedalor Ilves), and thus escort her back, or speak to Urtiso and offer to find her. Either way their room is now available for rent (5g/d) if the PC wants it. Aeliana will also give the PC one of her home brew each day. These will teleport the PC back to the house.
